# Coding Practice Archive

Welcome to my coding practice archive! This repository serves as a collection of coding questions I've completed on platforms like LeetCode. The structure of the repository is organized by problem types, making it easy to find and review solutions for different categories of problems.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
coding-practice/
├── Problem Type 1/
│ ├── Problem 1/
│ │ ├── solution.py
│ │ ├── test_solution.py
│ │ └── README.md
│ ├── Problem 2/
│ │ ├── solution.py
│ │ ├── test_solution.py
│ │ └── README.md
│ └── ...

## Folder Structure Explanation

- **Problem Type Folder:** Each top-level folder corresponds to a specific problem type (e.g., divide & conquer, graphs, string).

- **Problem Folder:** Inside each problem type folder, you'll find subfolders for individual problems. Each problem folder contains the following files:
  - `solution.py`: This file contains my solution to the problem.
  - `test_solution.py`: This file includes unit tests to validate the correctness of the solution.
  - `README.md`: This file provides a description of the problem, the approach I took to solve it, and any relevant notes.

Feel free to explore the repository and review the solutions I've implemented. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy coding!
